                <div class="insetborder">

                    <lead>On the evening of <i class="font-weight-bold">October 5th, 2005,</i> I was born into this
                        world. My parents named me in words
                        they
                        wish
                        to represent my soul and my believes. Since a child, I was trying to get answers, explore the
                        little things
                        around my neighborhood, and I would look at the <i class="font-weight-bold">constellations of
                            the star</i> at the countryside
                        crystal sky.
                        I'd prefer reading time with my mom and homework time inside the house, rather than running
                        around,
                        unlike most kids.
                    </lead>
                    <lead>
                        While slowly growing up, I learn about the people around me, the lives they live in the country
                        side
                        and the challenges they face.
                        I used to wonder, if life can be better, if there are answers to there ever-lasting problems,
                        and if
                        there is the solution that can bring
                        perfectionism to their lives.
                    </lead>
                    <lead>
                        If there is one thing I learn from these 14 years struggling joyfully through the puzzling maze
                        of
                        life,
                        I learn that perfectionism is not that solution, but continuous effort can. The efforts we make,
                        those small little
                        things we do, can ultimately bring powerful contributions to the world we live in. Everyone is
                        making a difference, whether to their own lives,
                        their own destinies, their identities, their own families, and ultimately the world.

                <p>
                    In Liger, I am travelling from Who I used to be to Who I will become as a <p
                        class="font-weight-bold" id="paddingleft">Positive Change Agent
                    </p>
                    <p>Liger is not just a school, but a family that we grow together as friends and learners. Through
                        living together, we have a chance to create close connections and bonds that allow us to live
                        happily as a community.
                        We are kind, empathetic, and helpful to each other. Living together from many different places
                        and
                        cultures requires a whole level of understanding and adaptation, which I really appreciate from
                        my
                        fellow friends.
                        We learn frome each other, have fun together, cry together, and most importantly, grow up
                        together.
                        Liger is a big part of my life that will never be replaced by any other place.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-success">
                        I can feel love, happiness, positivities and growth here. The place that determine who I am.
